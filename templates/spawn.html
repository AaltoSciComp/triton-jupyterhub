  2019-03-25 JupyterHub nodes are up again, everything should work.</font><br><br>

  2019-01-31 JupyterLab is now the default, but there are options for
  classic notebook as well.  It seems the lab-hub extension is not
  working, so to get back to the control panel go to the url "/hub/home".<br><br>

  Please use the minimum resources that meet your needs - but if you
  think you need more, DO use it: if it is here, it is OK to use.
  Tell us if you need more.  Be aware of the
